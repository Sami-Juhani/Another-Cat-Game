# Cat Game - A JavaScript Project

## About
I created this JavaScript game alongside my Information Technology studies at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. In this fun project, you'll take on the role of a cat and experience a world of adventure.

## Version
The game is currently at an advanced stage of development. It features graphics, physics, and a variety of sounds. The primary goal of the game is to navigate through challenges and avoid falling into the water. Be careful; this cat isn't much of a swimmer! While we've made great progress, there's still work to be done for a proper happy ending.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from developers who are passionate about making this cat game even more exciting. Feel free to clone this repository and submit your ideas. However, please note that all changes need to undergo a review process before they are merged.
